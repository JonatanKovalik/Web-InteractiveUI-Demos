## üìú Project Overview

This repository is a collection of my front-end web development demonstrations. It showcases my skills in building interactive user interfaces and crafting basic website layouts primarily using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The projects included here highlight my understanding of responsive design principles and client-side interactivity. This repository contains projects with accompanying image assets.

## ‚ú® Projects Included

Here are the web projects currently included in this repository:

* ### **`Project1` (Dynamic Landing Page / Interactive Element Demo)**
    * **Description:** This project ("Project1") is a foundational web page demonstrating the synergy between HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity. It likely features a responsive layout designed to adapt to various screen sizes, showcasing basic UI/UX principles. The JavaScript component provides dynamic behaviors, such as interactive elements or content manipulation, making the page engaging. It is structured with `index.html` for content, `style.css` for presentation, and `script.js` for functionality.
    * **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
    * **Key Concepts:** Responsive design, basic DOM manipulation, CSS layouts (e.g., Flexbox/Grid if used), event handling.
    * **Live Demo (Optional):** [Add a link to a live demo if you deploy this project, e.g., on GitHub Pages]
        * Example: `https://jonatankovalik.github.io/Web-InteractiveUI-Demos/Project1/` (You'd need to set up GitHub Pages for this repo).

* ### **`Learn` (Placeholder - Please Describe)**
    * **Description:** [Please add a brief description of what the 'Learn' folder contains. Is it code snippets, small exercises, or a specific mini-project?]
    * **Technologies:** [e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, specific frameworks/libraries]
    * **Key Concepts:** [Specific web development concepts explored in this project/folder.]
      
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* **Concepts:** Responsive Design, UI/UX Basics, DOM Manipulation, [Add more as you learn: e.g., CSS Flexbox, CSS Grid, Asynchronous JavaScript, APIs]
* **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Git, GitHub

## üß† Learning & Development

Working on these web projects has allowed me to strengthen my skills in **front-end development**, specifically in **responsive web design, JavaScript event handling, and dynamic content manipulation**. I've focused on **creating visually appealing and interactive user interfaces**, ensuring **clean and semantic HTML structure**, and **writing efficient CSS and JavaScript**. These exercises have provided practical experience in [mention specific learning, e.g., CSS Flexbox/Grid, understanding browser rendering, basic API integration, optimizing asset loading].
